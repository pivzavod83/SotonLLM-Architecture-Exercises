**LEVEL REACHED: [1/2/3/4]**

## LEVEL 1: ✅ [Level 1 screenshot](level1.png)

## LEVEL 2: ✅ 
- Code: [level2.py](level2.py)  
- Results: [results.txt](results.txt)
### Brief report:
*What did changing parameters do?*
*max_length:* larger values = longer outputs (but often increased repeating text)
*temperature:* higher temperature = increased variability, low temperature = generic output
*top_k:* larger top_k = increased diversity (reduced some repetition) 

*Which settings produced best results?*
temperature ≈ 1.0, top_k = 50–100, max_length = 50
These settings gave the most informative outputs while keeping creativity acceptable

*How long did generation take?*
Per run = ~3.0–3.5 s 
Total runs recorded: 135. Total compute time ≈ 7 minutes
